                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a junior at the University of California, Santa Cruz, majoring in Computer Science with a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models. My academic journey is fueled by a strong interest in developing innovative solutions and a commitment to continuous learning.</p>
                <p>I am actively involved in research and projects that explore AI, neural networks, and logical reasoning with LLMs. At UCSC, I am working at the AIEA Lab under the supervision of Professor Leilani Gilpin, where I am focusing on building robust and explainable AI systems. My work involves leveraging LLMs for logical inference and developing frameworks for coherent and transparent decision-making in AI.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I am leading the backend development for the "Veracity - LLM Story Generation" project. This involves creating a Python script to interact with the ChatGPT API, enabling dynamic chapter generation based on user inputs, summarizing historical data, and tracking character developments. I am also contributing to a research project under Professor Jason Eshraghian's guidance, where I develop tutorials on various models like Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and LSTM to enhance understanding of Streaming Aware Neural Network Models.</p>
                <p>I recently completed a Machine Learning Internship at SEE, where I gained hands-on experience working with advanced pose estimation algorithms such as YOLOv8, YOLO-World, and AlphaPose. My work also involved implementing a time-calculating algorithm for sports drills and contributing to the backend development of an app designed to help schools, students, and parents choose suitable sports for children. This role allowed me to deepen my knowledge of machine learning while aligning with SEE's mission of promoting fitness and injury prevention through technology.</p>
                <p>I am enthusiastic about continuing to explore the intersection of AI, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop impactful solutions. I am eager to connect with other professionals in the AI and LLM community and explore opportunities that foster innovation and growth.</p>
